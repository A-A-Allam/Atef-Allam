The founder of vascular / endovascular surgery department
Setting up of vascular / endovascular surgery department 
( As an Isolated department from general surgery department )
Till year 2000, vascular surgery has been a unit in general surgery department. Enormous effort was done by Prof. Atef Allam to set up a new vascular and endovascular department based on a new separate building and a new dedicated curriculum. Construction and design of the department, furniture, and equipment were carried out and supplied with personal effort by Prof. Atef Allam with help of Prof. Nabil Elmarasy and on charity base.   



Societies Foundation
I was one of founders of Vascular Society of Egypt 2004. I was a member of the first board of the society which designed and prepared for fore coming programs and activities of the society.  Being the first secretary general of the society I shared deeply and I was responsible for developing administrative and organizational plans and educational programs for young vascular surgeons all over the country and cultural programs for patients and citizens.

The Crisis of identity Ignitor 
Engineer of independency of vascular specialty as a separate department from general surgery department 
From the first moment in vascular surgery career, I was dreaming of independency day when vascular surgery is separated from general department as a dependent department all over Egypt. In year 2006 and through my position in vascular society of Egypt as a secretory general, I started a national campaign to spread the spirit of crisis of identity among colleagues in vascular surgery specialty all over Egypt. I started the campaign with an article titled, Message From Secretary General the Crisis Of Identity in the Egyptian Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Volume 2 Number 2 September 2006. During the campaign, I was in continuous communication with key professors in all Egyptian universities and other medical institutes and supplied them with all required documents till the independency day came. Now, vascular specialty is running and working as independent departments under the title Vascular And Endovascular Departments.

Other activities
Introducing of Endovascular Surgery in Egypt
I am one of the introducers of endovascular surgery in Egypt
 This was through two pass ways:
 1- In the vascular unit, surgical department, Al-Zahraa university hospital as one of the early medical centers in Egypt to practice endovascular surgery in early 1998. I trained about 30 vascular surgeons under my supervision on the principles of endovascular techniques.
2- In Egypt, being the first secretory general of vascular society of Egypt I organized through the continuous medical education program the first ever in Egypt a simulator based workshop on endovascular procedures (peripheral superficial femoral artery SFA, Iliac Artery, and carotid artery ) which was preceded by workshop training on endovascular basic tools (wires, catheters, stent etcâ€¦.) and techniques. This was followed by many programed hands-on workshops and lectures
Pioneer of Duplex Guided Indovascular Surgery in Egypt
Introducing of Duplex Guided Indovascular Surgery in Egypt
I advent and introduce Duplex guided Endovascular Intervention in Egypt 
1-	In Egypt as the only center ever to practice this novel technique in Egypt and one of few centers practicing this technique globally   
2-	In the vascular unit, surgical department, Al-Zahraa university hospital as a new field and novel technique in endovascular surgery to treat the patients who has risk of using contrast material without contrast or x-ray exposure. I trained many generations of young vascular surgeons on this novel procedure. Over time, now we stand as the pioneers and the only center practicing this technique in Egypt.
